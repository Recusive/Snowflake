# How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Snowflake! No contribution is too small and we consider _all_ contributions to the project.

## Feature Requests

A feature request is _editor behaviour that you want to have included in Snowflake_. We track feature requests on GitHub via [issues](https://github.com/Recusive/Snowflake/issues).

To reduce the number of duplicate requests, please search through the issues to see if something has already been suggested.
